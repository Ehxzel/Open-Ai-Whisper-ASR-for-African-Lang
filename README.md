# Open-Ai-Whisper-ASR-for-African-Lang
This is a Python notebook for Testing and Scoring OpenAI Whisper (Small) Model's ability to work with West African Languages

This code demonstrates how an audio file can be uploaded, processed, and visually analyzed using AI tools. It loads an audio recording, converts it to a standard format, and then creates two visual representations:

A waveform that shows how the sound changes over time, and
A Mel spectrogram that displays the sound’s frequency patterns in color.
These visuals help us understand how speech or sound is structured before it’s analyzed by Whisper for transcription or language understanding. at the last end of the Script, theh WER and CER Scores are added.
